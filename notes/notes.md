### [JavaScript ES6+: var, let, or const?](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-es6-var-let-or-const-ba58b8dcde75)

Unlike true immutable datatypes such as those produced by Immutable.js and Mori, a `const` object can have properties mutated.

`const` is a signal that the identifier wonâ€™t be reassigned.

`let`, is a signal that the variable may be reassigned. It also signals that the variable will be used only in the block itâ€™s defined in, which is not always the entire containing function.

`var` is now the weakest signal available when you define a variable in JavaScript. The variable may or may not be reassigned, and the variable may or may not be used for an entire function, or just for the purpose of a block or loop.
