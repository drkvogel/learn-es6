### WhatSup

Beverage-ordering system for doing rounds in pubs
* One user creates a group on their phone
* Other people in the group join
* Someone is nominated to go to the bar
* Everyone places their orders
* The 

Des [designated driver] should NEVER have to buy a round.

Buyer, shouter...?


### yarn msg from cra:

(but README suggests npm)

```
Success! Created whatsup at /Users/kvogel/Projects/learn-es6/websockets/whatsup
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start Starts the development server.
  yarn build Bundles the app into static files for production.
  yarn test Starts the test runner.
  yarn eject Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd whatsup
  yarn start

Happy hacking!
